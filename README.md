<h1>Network Hardening</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this task, I was asked to review the following scenario and write up a security risk assessment report to throw light on the incident and suggest ways to further secure the network:

You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 
After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:
1.	The organization’s employees' share passwords.
2.	The admin password for the database is set to the default.
3.	The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.
4.	Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 
If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 
In this activity, you will write a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further secure the network.

The report should include answers to the following:
Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement
Part 2: Explain your recommendation(s)

<h2>Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement</h2>
Three essential hardening tools that the organization can employ to address the identified vulnerabilities are as follows:

1. Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):
MFA enhances security by requiring users to provide multiple forms of identification and verification before accessing an application. This approach significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access. MFA methods can include fingerprint scans, ID cards, pin numbers, and passwords.

2. Strong Password Policies:
Implementing and enforcing robust password policies is crucial for bolstering security. These policies can include rules regarding password length, acceptable character combinations, and warnings against sharing passwords. Additionally, setting limits on unsuccessful login attempts, such as locking the user out after five failed attempts, helps prevent brute-force attacks.

3. Regular Firewall Maintenance:
Ensuring the firewall's effectiveness involves performing regular maintenance and security configuration updates. By staying vigilant in checking and updating firewall settings, the organization can proactively address potential threats and maintain a secure network environment.

By employing these hardening measures, the organization can significantly enhance its cybersecurity posture and reduce the likelihood of successful attacks.

<h2>Explain your recommendation(s)</h2>

Enforcing multi-factor authentication (MFA) significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access to the network, thwarting brute force and related attacks. Additionally, MFA discourages internal password sharing within the organization, ensuring enhanced security, especially for employees with administrator level privileges. Regular and rigorous enforcement of MFA is crucial for sustained protection.

Implementation of a robust password policy is essential in fortifying network security against malicious actors. By adhering to the password policy's rules and enforcing them consistently, the organization can bolster user security effectively.

Regular maintenance of the firewall is of utmost importance. Keeping the firewall rules up-to-date, especially after any security event that allows suspicious network traffic, provides robust defense against various DoS and DDoS attacks. Ensuring the firewall's integrity through routine checks and updates is vital for safeguarding the network's overall security.
